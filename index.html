                                If u did more coding than just writing "Hello world! Nobody really knows who first ordered a computer to say “Hello, World!” But it began its ascent to nerd fame back in 1972, when the computer scientist Brian Kernighan was writing a manual for the language B. He wanted to demo B’s ability to take little scraps of text and assemble them. "

                                But it is clear that the romance of the craft can intoxicate, and that we might want to watch out for that. In recent years, several coders have argued persuasively that computer science students should exposed to more courses in history, art, literature, or anthropology. Those are great ways to begin grasping the messy, grayscale nature of society. You learn that culture and politics and civic life are complex systems that rarely behave the way you expect them to.

                            <p>While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello, World!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the 1978 book The C Programming Language, but there is no evidence that 'hello world' originated there, and it is very likely it was used in BCPL beforehand. </p>

                            <p>"Hello, World!" programs vary in complexity between different languages. In some languages, particularly scripting languages, the "Hello, World!" program can be written as a single statement, while in others (particularly many low-level languages) there can be many more statements required. </p>
